<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<h4>
  Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this project.
  Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what
  interesting things you've learned from completing the project.
</h4>
<p>
  In this project, I implemented cloth simulation by following the PointMass and Spring method.
  This required building the PointMass-Spring grid itself, applying various forces to said PointMasses
  to simulate things like gravity, colliding the cloth with primitives such as spheres and planes,
  and colliding the cloth with itself. I also implemented GLSL Shaders that run in parallel on the GPU so that my simulation could
  look pretty without taking hours to render!
</p>

<h2 align="middle">Part 1: Masses and springs</h2>
  <h4>Describe what you did in Part 1. etc...</h4>
  <p>
    In Part 1, I wrote the code that represents a grid of masses and springs.
    To do this I first made num_width_points x num_height_points PointMasses, 
    oriented horizontally or vertically them based on the orientation variable, 
    then emplaced them to the back of the point_masses vector. Next, for every
    PointMass in the point_masses vector, I created it's structural, shearing,
    and bending springs and added them to the springs vector if they should exist.
  </p>

  <h4>

    where you can clearly see the cloth wireframe to show the structure
    of your point masses and springs.

<h2 align="middle">Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
  <h4>Describe what you did in Part 2. etc...</h4>
  <p>
    In Part 2 I simulated external and spring correction forces to
    act on the PointMasses that make up our cloth. I then used Verlet integration
    to find the new positions of the PointMasses after the forces are applied to
    them. To better mimic real world behavior, I limited how far each spring
    could stretch by constraining the distance each pair of connected PointMasses
    could be apart from one another.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Experiment with some the parameters in the simulation.
    To do so, pause the simulation at the start with P, modify the
    values of interest, and then resume by pressing P again.
    You can also restart the simulation at any time from the
    cloth's starting position by pressing R.
  </h3>
  <br>

  <h4>
    Describe the effects of changing the spring constant ks;
    how does the cloth behave from start to rest with a very low ks? A high ks?
  </h4>
  <p>
    With a low ks (less than 100) the cloth seems to vibrate
    after swiftly falling to a resting position.
    With a high ks (above 10000000) the cloth falls to a resting
    position very rigidly. While in a resting position, it is much
    less flexible than the sub 100 or 5000 counterparts. It seems
    that the cloth goes from a simulating a free-flowing and light
    material like netting to a dense and stiff material such as 
    construction paper and beyond as ks goes from low values to high values.
  </p>

  <h4>
    What about for density?
  </h4>
  <p>
    A low density value like 1 seems to reflect a material that doesn't weigh much
    like netting. It holds it's top edge at almost a straight line, which
    means that there is not much weight pulling the material down between the pinned
    PointMasses. On the other hand, a high density value such as 10000 visually looks
    very heavy as if it could be simulating chainmail. The top edge sinks down about
    an eighth of the way down the entire mesh! We can also notice that PointMasses jiggle
    around unlike the low density case.
    This tells us that there is lots of stress on the springs when there is high density.
    We can conclude that as density goes from low to high, the material simulated goes
    from one that doesn't weigh much to one that weighs a lot.
  </p>

  <h4>
    What about for damping?
  </h4>
  <p>
    In our simulation, low values of damping like 0 appear to accerate the cloth's movement
    while higher values of damping like 1 appear to slow the cloth's movement down.
    From lecture we know that this is a product of a flaw in our simulation approach, so 
    we can discard that feature and look to the others. At low values of damping,
    we can observe that the cloth swings about rather than falling to it's resting position.
    It is wavy and jittery almost like a sheet drying in the wind. As the damping factor
    increases, we can observe the cloth rest to a halt. Replaying the simulation
    with a damping factor of 1 shows the cloth falling down to it's resting position
    and immediately stopping. It appears that the damping factor controls how powerful
    springs in our model are at constraining the movement of the PointMasses. Low values
    of damping mean that springs have little control over the forces exerted on the cloth
    other than holding the cloth together. As damping values rise, springs get better and better
    at making PointMasses less affected by other forces.
  </p>

  <h4>
    For each of the above, observe any noticeable differences
    in the cloth compared to the default parameters and show
    us some screenshots of those interesting differences and
    describe when they occur.

<h2 align="middle">Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
  <h4>Describe what you did in Part 3. etc...</h4>
  <p>
    In Part 3, I added collision to my cloth simulation. First, I added collision with
    spheres by bumping a PointMass a little above the sphere if it ever crosses over the
    sphere's surface or rests on the surface. I also implemented collisions with planes by doing the same if it
    a PointMass crosses from one side of the plane's surface or rests on the surface. Both
    of these involved finding the intersection point, finding an offset point a little on
    the outside of the object's intersection point, and applying a correction vector scaled
    by friction to correct the every PointMass's position that intersects.
  </p>

  <h4>
    Show us screenshots of your shaded cloth from
    scene/sphere.json in its final resting state on the

    As ks goes from a low value to a high value, the cloth
    seems to go from simulating a thin material to simulating

    the cloth falls into place more swiftly. At higher values,
    less folds appear and the cloth slowly pulls itself into place.
    When ks = 50, the cloth looks like it is
    simulating a bandana. When ks = 500 the cloth looks like it
    is simulating a tablecloth. When ks = 5000, the cloth looks

    looks like it is simulating a sheet of rubber.

    Displacement shading looks weird because the displaced plane vectors clip into the mesh's vertices or vice versa.
    Cell shading (my extra credit shader) looks weird because the light hitting the flat plane
    and the flat cloth fall into the same bucket.

<h2 align="middle">Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
  <h4>Describe what you did in Part 4. etc...</h4>
  <p>
    In Part 4 I created and accelerated collisions between the cloth and itself.
    To do this, I assigned PointMasses hashes based on their position in the scene
    so that PointMasses with the same hash are in the same partition of the scene space.
    Then I used this hash to put PointMasses that are close in proximity into the same
    bin in a spatial map. Then I loop through all PointMasses, see if the current PointMass
    collides with any other PointMass in it's spatial map bin, and apply a correcting
    force to it if it does collide.
  </p>

  <h4>
    Show us at least 3 screenshots that document how your
    cloth falls and folds on itself, starting with an early,
    initial self-collision and ending with the cloth at a more
    restful state (even if it is still slightly bouncy on the ground).

    High ks and low density are similar. Low ks and high density are similar.
    The main difference between low ks and high density seems to be that low ks
    is much more bubbly and "springy" than the cloth with high density. For the
    low ks case, think of steamy boiling water. For the high density case, think
    of bubbling stew.
    The main difference between high ks and low
    density seems to be that high ks PointMasses are constrained more by
    adjacent PointMasses than the low density case.

<h2 align="middle">Part 5: Shaders</h2>
  <h4>Describe what you did in Part 5. etc...</h4>
  <p>
    In Part 5 I was able to make my cloth simulation look pretty
    in real time by implementing GLSL Shaders! GLSL Shaders run in
    parallel on the GPU, so they can do lots of computationally intensive
    work to make simulations look pretty without affecting preformance too
    much. The mandatory shaders I implemented were Diffuse Shading,
    Blinn-Phong Shading, Texture Mapping, Bump Mapping,
    Displacement Mapping, and Environment-mapped Reflections (similar to a mirror).
    I also did extra credit to make my own shader... A Cell Shader!
  </p>

  <h4>
    Explain in your own words what is a shader program
    and how vertex and fragment shaders work together
    to create lighting and material effects.
  </h4>
  <p>
    A shader program is a program that runs parallel on the GPU so that
    real-time renders can look good while still running fast. While the
    CPU calculates things such as collisions and mesh building that have
    to be done while knowing what everything else in the scene is doing,
    a shader program can run without needing to know those interactions.
    Because of that, we can essentialy pixel sample in parallel super fast
    and render an impressive scene at a quick speed while keeping a similar
    framerate. To write shaders in this project, I used GLSL. This parallelization
    feature allows shaders to do almost the same thing as the illumination functions
    I implemented in Project3, but with a different workflow.
    <br><br>
    To create lighting
    and material effects, a shader program uses vertex and fragment shaders.
    Vertex shaders change the geometric properties of vertices retrieved from
    the program running on the CPU. They can update the positions, normals, etc.
    of vertexes before sending that info over to fragment shaders. After
    handling and sending these vertex values, the values are interpolated
    over the polygon they will appear on.
    Fragment shaders take these interpolated values sent from the vertex shader
    and use them to change how the output pixels are colored. To keep things simple,
    if you want to edit the features in a scene you'd write a vertex shader. If you
    want to change how the features in that scene are colored, you'd want to write a
    fragment shader.
  </p>

  <h4>
    Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words.
    Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting
    only the ambient component, a screen shot only outputting
    the diffuse component, a screen shot only outputting the
    specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.
  </h4>
  <p>
    The Blinn-Phong shading model is a variation of the Phong shading model
    that is faster for directionally lit scenes. This shading model has
    components of diffuse shading, ambient shading, and specular shading.
    I'll give examples of the three below. The combination of these three
    means that we could make it so our objects look globally illuminated
    really quickly. The algorithm is as follows: separately compute ambient color,
    diffuse color, and specular color. Use the Diffuse Shading equation to get
    diffuse color. For specular color (the part the relects the shiny light), if
    the dot product between the direction to the light and the vertex normal (both
    normalized) is positive, then find the halfangle and put the halfangle to
    a power depending on how much you want the shine of the specular color to span.

  <p>
    Here it is very clear that Bump Shading "projects" features on to the surface of the
    objects to give the illusion that they extrude, while displacement shading actually
    moves the vertices. This is because in bump shading we only modify normals
    based on texture features, while in displacement shading we modify normals and
    vector positions. I chose to use a texture with high red contrast so it's easy to
    differentiate vectors that have been moved. The sphere clearly shows extruding vertices
    at areas that are red from the texture. It's harder to tell on the cloth, but it's still there.

    Below we will compare bump and displacement when we change the mesh's coarseness.

  <p>
    As the coarseness of the mesh increases, there is little to no quality increase
    on Bump Shading other than the roundness of the sphere. Displacement Shading, however,
    sees massive quality improvements. The introduction of more vertices means that
    displacements can be more precise. This is why the sphere goes from looking like a
    spiky ball with a texture projected onto it at -o 16 -a 16, to a planet with mountains
    at default settings, to a ball with hairs at -o 128 -a 128. In total, Bump Shading
    looks about the same on objects with varying coarseness, but Displacement Shading gets
    far more detailed as coarseness increases.

  <p>For my custom shader, I chose to make a cell shader. The idea behind
    a cell shader is that it bins similar color values into groups, then chooses
    one color to represent that entire group of colors. This simulates how
    colors are often used in cartoons and gives the world a comical feel.
    To find these bins, I decided to use the dot product between the direction
    to light and the normal.
